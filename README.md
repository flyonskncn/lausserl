# recon.sh
This tool is for the computer hacking community and gives a framework for storing reconnaissance (recon) information. Recon is a tedious and continuous process that involves mentally processing and parsing command output. Conclusions drawn from this output can lead to new insights about an asset or may even identify security vulnerabilities. In proper recon, assets are scanned on a regular bases and the output of the commands are compared. The wrappers in this tool allow you to collect recon information from multiple nodes in a single git repository and gives an easy interface to search it.
